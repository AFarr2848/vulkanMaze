# Learning Vulkan
This is a project that I am working on to learn to use Vulkan! I started off with the tutorial at https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest but have since branched of and completely redone everything.


## How It's Made:

This project is almost completely in C++ and uses the C++ Vulkan bindings. I'm actually kind of learning C++ for the first time while doing this! My goal is to do as much of the project as possible, including all of the structure and algorithms, without the use of LLMs. The goal here is to learn, after all!

## Lessons Learned:

This project has been super educational, teaching me an unbelievable amount about graphics, C++, and maintaining a big-ish project that uses a complex API. In the future I think I'm just going to keep making whatever I think looks cool at the time and maybe I'll have a full engine at some point!

## Building:

If you want to build this yourself, make sure you have:
- `cmake`
- `vulkan-devel`
- `assimp`
- `pkg-config`
- `slangc`
I think lol maybe there's more

Then just clone, run `build.sh`, then run `build/VulkanTest`
